#### A Typescript React Docker MariaDB Stack

### Developer Instructions

#### Running in Docker + Docker Compose

```
bin/go
```

And you're good to go!

#### Without Docker

You'll need:
- Node.js
- MariaDB running

then execute

```
yarn
npm start

You can also pass the `MARIADB_URL` environment variable to the process to set the correct mariadb instance.
